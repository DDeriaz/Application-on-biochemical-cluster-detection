	abstract = {The pathogenic role of Na(+) in primary hypertension is widely recognized but that of K(+) remains unappreciated. Yet, extensive evidence indicates that together, the body's dominant cations constitute the chief environmental factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension and its cardiovascular sequelae. In this Review, we provide a synthesis of the determinants of Na(+) retention and K(+) loss developing in the body as the Na(+)-rich and K(+)-poor modern diet interacts with kidneys intrinsically poised to conserve Na(+) and excrete K(+); and the molecular pathways utilized by these disturbances in the central nervous system and the periphery to increase sympathetic tone and vascular resistance, and establish hypertension. These fresh insights point to new directions for targeted pharmacotherapy of hypertension. The interdependency of Na(+) and K(+) in the pathogenesis of hypertension indicates that Na(+) restriction and increased K(+) intake are important strategies for the primary prevention and treatment of hypertension and its cardiovascular consequences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several epidemiologic studies suggested that higher sodium and lower potassium intakes were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Few studies have examined joint effects of dietary sodium and potassium intake on risk of mortality.
METHODS: To investigate estimated usual intakes of sodium and potassium as well as their ratio in relation to risk of all-cause and CVD mortality, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File (1988-2006), a prospective cohort study of a nationally representative sample of 12,267 US adults, studied all-cause, cardiovascular, and ischemic heart (IHD) diseases mortality.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 14.8 years, we documented a total of 2270 deaths, including 825 CVD deaths and 443 IHD deaths. After multivariable adjustment, higher sodium intake was associated with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.41 per 1000 mg/d), whereas higher potassium intake was associated with lower mortality risk (HR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.94 per 1000 mg/d). For sodium-potassium ratio, the adjusted HRs comparing the highest quartile with the lowest quartile were HR, 1.46 (95\% CI, 1.27-1.67) for all-cause mortality; HR, 1.46 (95\% CI, 1.11-1.92) for CVD mortality; and HR, 2.15 (95\% CI, 1.48-3.12) for IHD mortality. These findings did not differ significantly by sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, hypertension status, education levels, or physical activity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a higher sodium-potassium ratio is associated with significantly increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, and higher sodium intake is associated with increased total mortality in the general US population.},

	shorttitle = {Intersalt revisited},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess further the relation in Intersalt of 24 hour urinary sodium to blood pressure of individuals and populations, and the difference in blood pressure from young adulthood into middle age.
DESIGN: Standardised cross sectional study within and across populations.
SETTING: 52 population samples in 32 countries.
SUBJECTS: 10,074 men and women aged 20-59.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of sodium and blood pressure from within population and cross population multiple linear regression analyses with multivariate correction for regression dilution bias. Relation of sample median daily urinary sodium excretion to difference in blood pressure with age.
RESULTS: In within population analyses (n = 10,074), individual 24 hour urinary sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol (for example, 170 v 70 mmol) was associated with systolic/diastolic blood pressure higher on average by 3/0 to 6/3 mm Hg (with and without body mass in analyses). Associations were larger at ages 40-59. In cross population analyses (n = 52), sample median 24 hour sodium excretion higher by 100 mmol was associated with median systolic/diastolic pressure higher on average by 5-7/2-4 mm Hg, and estimated mean difference in systolic/diastolic pressure at age 55 compared with age 25 greater by 10-11/6 mm Hg.
CONCLUSIONS: The strong, positive association of urinary sodium with systolic pressure of individuals concurs with Intersalt cross population findings and results of other studies. Higher urinary sodium is also associated with substantially greater differences in blood pressure in middle age compared with young adulthood. These results support recommendations for reduction of high salt intake in populations for prevention and control of adverse blood pressure levels.},

	doi = {10.3945/ajcn.114.101188},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary nitrate, which is in green leafy vegetables and beetroot, decreases blood pressure through the enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway in healthy individuals. Whether similar effects would occur in individuals with treated hypertension and, therefore, at increased risk of cardiovascular disease is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether increased dietary nitrate intake by using beetroot juice for 1 wk lowers blood pressure in treated hypertensive men and women.
DESIGN: Participants (n = 27) were recruited to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial. The effect of 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice was compared with 1-wk intake of nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (placebo). The primary outcome was blood pressure assessed by measuring home blood pressure during the intervention and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure on day 7 of the intervention. Other outcomes included nitrate metabolism assessed by measuring nitrate and nitrite in plasma, saliva, and urine.
RESULTS: Relative to the placebo, 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice resulted in a 3-fold increase in plasma nitrite and nitrate, a 7-fold increase in salivary nitrite, an 8-fold higher salivary nitrate, and a 4-fold increase in both urinary nitrite and nitrate (P {\textless} 0.001). However, no differences in home blood pressure and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were observed with 1-wk intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice in comparison with the placebo.
CONCLUSION: An increase in dietary nitrate intake may not be an effective short-term approach to further lower blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects.},

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the link between habitual dietary patterns and metabolomic profiles.
DESIGN: A total of 160 volunteers participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary intervention. We collected biofluids and recorded 3-d food diaries. Food data were reduced to 33 food groups, and a k-means cluster analysis was performed to identify dietary patterns. (1)H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired for plasma and urine samples, and gas chromatography was used for plasma fatty acid profiling.
RESULTS: Cluster analysis identified 3 distinct dietary patterns on the basis of the energy contribution of different food groups. Dietary clusters were reflected in plasma fatty acid profiles and in metabolomic data. (1)H NMR spectra of urine allowed the identification of metabolites associated with different dietary patterns. Several of the metabolites identified were linked to the intake of specific food groups; in particular, there was a positive association between O-acetylcarnitine and phenylacetylglutamine and red-meat and vegetable intakes, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Habitual dietary patterns are shown in metabolomic data. This approach successfully identified potential biomarkers of red-meat and vegetable intakes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence and the level of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in different world regions.
STUDY SELECTION: A literature search of the MEDLINE database, using the Medical Subject Headings prevalence, hypertension, blood pressure and cross-sectional studies, was conducted. Published studies, which reported the prevalence of hypertension and were conducted in representative population samples, were included in the review. The search was restricted to studies published from January 1980 through July 2003.
DATA EXTRACTION: All data were extracted independently by two investigators using a standardized protocol and data collection form.
RESULTS: The reported prevalence of hypertension varied around the world, with the lowest prevalence in rural India (3.4\% in men and 6.8\% in women) and the highest prevalence in Poland (68.9\% in men and 72.5\% in women). Awareness of hypertension was reported for 46\% of the studies and varied from 25.2\% in Korea to 75\% in Barbados; treatment varied from 10.7\% in Mexico to 66\% in Barbados and control (blood pressure {\textless} 140/90 mmHg while on antihypertensive medication) varied from 5.4\% in Korea to 58\% in Barbados.
CONCLUSION: Hypertension is an important public health challenge in both economically developing and developed countries. Significant numbers of individuals with hypertension are unaware of their condition and, among those with diagnosed hypertension, treatment is frequently inadequate. Measures are required at a population level to prevent the development of hypertension and to improve awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in the community.},

	doi = {10.1006/rtph.2000.1441},
	abstract = {Aluminum is a nonessential metal to which humans are frequently exposed. Aluminum in the food supply comes from natural sources, water used in food preparation, food ingredients, and utensils used during food preparations. The amount of aluminum in the diet is small, compared with the amount of aluminum in antacids and some buffered analgesics. The healthy human body has effective barriers (skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract) to reduce the systemic absorption of aluminum ingested from water, foods, drugs, and air. The small amount of aluminum ({\textless}1\%) that is systemically absorbed is excreted principally in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in the feces. No reports of dietary aluminum toxicity to healthy individuals exist in the literature. Aluminum can be neurotoxic, when injected directly into the brains of animals and when accidentally introduced into human brains (by dialysis or shrapnel). A study from Canada reports cognitive and other neurological deficits among groups of workers occupationally exposed to dust containing high levels of aluminum. While the precise pathogenic role of aluminum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be defined, present data do not support a causative role for aluminum in AD. High intake of aluminum from antacid for gastrointestinal ailments has not been reported to cause any adverse effects and has not been correlated with neurotoxicity or AD. Foods and food ingredients are generally the major dietary sources of aluminum in the United States. Cooking in aluminum utensils often results in statistically significant, but relatively small, increases in aluminum content of food. Common aluminum-containing food ingredients are used mainly as preservatives, coloring agents, leavening agents, anticaking agents, etc. Safety evaluation and approval of these ingredients by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that these aluminum-containing compounds are safe for use in foods.},

To lower blood pressure (BP), several lifestyle changes are recommended such as weight loss, exercise, and following a healthy diet. Investigating the effect of single nutrients may have positive results, but food is consumed as part of a whole diet, resulting in nutrient interactions. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of dietary patterns on BP in adults. Studies that were published between January 1999 and June 2014 were retrieved using Scopus, Web of Science, and the MEDLINE database. Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggest that healthy dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, Nordic diet, and Mediterranean diet significantly lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP by 4.26 mm Hg and 2.38 mm Hg, respectively. These diets are rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, fish, and dairy and low in meat, sweets, and alcohol. Lifestyle factors such as exercise and weight loss in combination with dietary changes may also reduce BP. Further research is needed to establish the effect of dietary patterns on BP in different cultures other than those identified in this review. The review was registered on PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews) as CRD42015016272.},

Some of the trace metals are thus essential for maintaining homeostasis, while deficiency of these trace metals can cause disorders with metabolic and physiological imbalances. This article concentrates on three trace metals (selenium, vanadium, and chromium) that may play crucial roles in controlling blood glucose concentrations possibly through their insulin-mimetic effects. For these trace metals, the level of evidence available for their health effects as supplements is weak. Thus, their potential is not fully exploited for the target of metabolic syndrome, a constellation that increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Given that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing throughout the world, a simpler option of interventions with food supplemented with well-studied trace metals could serve as an answer to this problem. The oxidation state and coordination chemistry play crucial roles in defining the responses to these trace metals, so further research is warranted to understand fully their metabolic and cardiovascular effects in human metabolic syndrome.},

These clustering methods were designed to be robust and to accept dissimilarity data as well as objects-by-variables data. Moreover, they each provide a graphical display and a quality index reflecting the strength of the clustering. The powerful graphics of S-PLUS made it possible to improve these graphical representations considerably.  The integration of the clustering algorithms was performed according to the object-oriented principle supported by S-PLUS. The new functions have a uniform interface, and are compatible with existing S-PLUS functions. We will describe the basic idea and the use of each clustering method, together with its graphical features. Each function is briefly illustrated with an example.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.},
