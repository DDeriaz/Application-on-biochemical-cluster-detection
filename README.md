# Application on biochemical cluster detection

## Summary

The thesis focuses on exploring the relationship between biochemical elements, particularly metal-mixtures and non-metals, and hypertension. Using data from the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes in Hypertension (SKIPOGH), the study applies principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis to identify patterns in biochemical elements from urine samples. These patterns are then analyzed to understand their association with hypertension. The study aims to improve the prediction and understanding of hypertension through clustering methods and dimensionality reduction. This approach provides a novel perspective on hypertension, emphasizing the role of environmental and dietary factors in its development.

## Acknowlegements

It was a real pleasure to study Statistics at the University of Neuch√¢tel. All the teachers were kind and encouraging. These studies allowed me to have a deeper understanding of the biomedical research. Moreover, the `R` courses given by Dr Alina Matei developed my knowledge in `R` such that I currently couldn't imagine another software than `R` to do Statistics.

I would like also to thank Prof. Murielle Bochud at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Lausanne for giving her medical expertise and providing the medical data, and Claire Mudge for her English revision.
